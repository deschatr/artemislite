Rules of ArtemisLite

ArtemisLite is a board game for 2 to 4 players.
The board consists of a start Square, a blank square and 10 projects squares grouped in 4 programs.
Each players has a token and a certain amount of funding available to spend on project bids, developments and fines.

The goal of the game is to develop all the Artemis projects in order to have a successful launch of the Artemis Missions.

In order to do this, players will can bid for projects and then develop those projects through development phases.
But please note that a player can only develop a project if they have successfully bid for all the projects within the same program.

Each player's turn consists in 2 steps:

1. Move the token
 2 dice roll and the token is moved by the total amount given by the dice.
 A $20M funding is awarded every time a player's token passes by the start square.
 If the token lands on a project square that is available, the player can choose to bid for that project. If the player chose not to bid, the project is offered to the other players.
 If the token lands on a project square owned by another player, a fine may have to be paid, at the discretion of the owner of the square.
 If the token lands on a project square owned by the player, or on the blank square, nothing happens.

2. Develop projects
 The player can choose to develop any of the project that the player has successfully bid on, if:
 - the player owns all the projects within the program the project to be developed belongs to
 - the player has sufficient funding to develop the project
